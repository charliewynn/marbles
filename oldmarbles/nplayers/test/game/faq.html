  <h1>Creating a game</h1>
  To create a new game you need to go to <a href="http://cwynn.com/marbles/nplayers/test/board.html">the board designer</a>.<br>
  There you can change paramers about the game like the number of players, number of marbles, board design, and some of the layout.<br>
  You'll also be able to name each player and change their color.<br><br>
  You can also print the layout of the board.<br><br>
  Once you're done designing the board click 'Start Game' and you'll be re-directed (disable your pop-up blocker!) to your marbles board.<br>
  You'll need to copy the url from the address bar and give it to the other players.<br><br>
  
  <h1>In-Game controls</h1>
  The game is updated by constantly polling the server for the latest game-state.  You can pause/unpause polling by clicking the upper right-hand corner of the board (Where it says "Polling" or "Paused")<br><br>
  If the game is polling any changes/moves you make will be lost when the game refreshes (every 5 seconds).<br>
  
  To roll the dice you need to click the 'roll' button (not the dice themselves!)
  
  The game should automatically pause polling once you roll the dice or begin to move a marble.<br><br>
  It is possible that you will begin moving a marble right as the game is sending the current state and the marble will be reset to its old position.  Moving it again should always work the second time.
  
  When you have finished making your move you need to click "save" to save your changes to the server.  Once your changes have been saved the game should begin polling again.<br><br>
  
  When it is your turn <b> Roll - Move Marbles - Save </b><br><br>
  
  <h1>Tip for iPhone Users</h1>
  If you go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Zoom and turn zoom on...<br>
  You can double tap the screen with three fingers, keeping your fingers down on the second tap.  Then slide up/down to zoom in/out.<br>
  While zoomed you can pan the screen with three fingers

  <h1>Creating a game</h1>
  To create a new game you need to go to <a href="http://cwynn.com/marbles">the board designer</a>.<br>
  There you can change parameters about the game like the number of players, number of marbles, board design, and some of the layout.<br>
  You'll also be able to name each player and change their color.<br><br>
  You can also print the layout of the board.<br><br>
  Once you're done designing the board click 'Start Game' and you'll be re-directed (disable your pop-up blocker!) to your marbles board.<br>
  You'll need to copy the url from the address bar and give it to the other players.<br><br>
  
  <h1>In-Game controls</h1>
  The game is updated by constantly polling the server for the latest game-state.  It checks for an updates every 3 seconds.<br><br><br>
  
  To roll the dice you need to click the 'roll' button (not the dice themselves!)
  
  The game will automatically pause polling once you roll the dice or begin to move a marble.<br><br>
  
  When you have finished making your move you need to click "save" to save your changes to the server.  Once your changes have been saved the game should begin polling again.<br><br>
  
  When it is your turn <b> Roll - Move Marbles - Save </b><br><br>
